# The_Global_Project
Set of functions meant to make writing backend scripts more concise, plus some extra meant to make equating and analysis easier.

Please feel free to grab functions that you might want to use.

Also feel free to contribute to the repository! If you can find a way to make a function better, or add your own :)
